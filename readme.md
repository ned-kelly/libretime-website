# Libretime website

Just a "onepager" website for the Libretime homepage...

* This site is intended to be merged into the main Libretime project

* You can access it (for reviewing purposes) via [Github Pages](https://ned-kelly.github.io/libretime-website/) _(for now)_ whilst waiting for the [PR](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/pull/590) to be approved.

## Running/developing
